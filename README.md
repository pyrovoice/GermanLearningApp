## TODOs

- Fix the word pool to not get reloaded every cycle
- Populate the word library.
- Add sentences.
- Add an activity to review learned words and put them back in the learning pool if forgotten.
- Testing
- Pause/Resume functionality

## Final words:

To whoever could see this: it's an ongoing project and some quality is still missing (unit testing, integration testing, some functionalities). I also voluntarely kept the UI as simple as possible.
This was my second project ever in mobile development.
